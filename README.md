### Unlock Undercollateralized DeFi Loans with Your Trade File Credit Score!

An on-chain financial credit score makes users eligible for better DeFi loans, as by proving their real-world creditworthiness to web3 lenders they can now access true undercollateralized loans and get better interest rates on their regular overcollateralized loans. By providing retailers a new avenue to get loans through their existing credit bureau data on-chain, and without having to reveal their real identities in the process, we can smoothly onboard many new web3 users.
