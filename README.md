### Unlock Undercollateralized DeFi Loans with Your Trade File Credit Score!

There exists a divide between TradFi and DeFi. Despite the majority of the persons being active in TradFi while possessing tangible credit and credit history, when they are onramped to DeFi they have to leave this strength behind. Due to the lack of interoperability, one has to start from scratch when taking loans fron web3 lenders, having to deposit large collaterals to receive loans. Humans possess most of their wealth in the traditional financial systems and markets, and DeFi is ripe to take advantage of that, if only their credit history and credit score can be onramped to web3.

SCORE! allows users to bring their credit history on-chain, with one big difference: they can now do so anonymously. By preserving user privacy and simultaneously onramping their credit score to be used safely in DeFi, we provide a massive opportunity to truly onramp new users to web3 in the millions, providing them an alternate space to take safe, undercollateralized or overcollateralized loans with attractive interest rates, mitigating risk for lenders and borrowers alike and making the loan system capital efficient.
